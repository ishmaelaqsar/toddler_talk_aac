* Toddler Talk - AAC for Early Intervention

Toddler Talk is an Android (and iOS) application designed specifically for non-verbal toddlers (ages 1-3).
Unlike general AAC apps, it prioritizes **instant feedback**, **large motor targets**, and **safety** to prevent accidental edits by curious fingers.
It utilizes evidence-based strategies for early intervention, focusing on specific "Needs" over abstract "Core Words."

** 🌟 Features

*** 👶 Toddler Mode (The Default)
- **Instant Speak:** Tapping a picture speaks immediately.
- **Large Targets:** Giant icons designed for developing motor skills.
- **Locked UI:** No delete buttons, settings menus, or edit tools are visible to the child.
