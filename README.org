* Toddler Talk - AAC for Early Intervention

Toddler Talk is an Android (and iOS) application designed specifically for non-verbal toddlers (ages 1-3). Unlike general AAC apps, it prioritizes **instant feedback**, **large motor targets**, and **safety** to prevent accidental edits by curious fingers.

It utilizes evidence-based strategies for early intervention, focusing on specific "Needs" over abstract "Core Words."

** 🌟 Features

*** 👶 Toddler Mode (The Default)
- **Instant Speak:** Tapping a picture speaks immediately. No complex "Sentence Strips" to confuse early learners.
- **Large Targets:** Giant icons designed for developing motor skills.
- **Locked UI:** No delete buttons, settings menus, or edit tools are visible to the child.
- **Sensory Friendly:** Soft pastels (Blue/Cream) and no distracting animations.

*** 👩‍👦 Mom Mode (Admin)
- **Safety Lock:** Access editing tools by **Long Pressing** the lock icon (top right).
- **Custom Photos:** Use the camera to take pictures of the child's *actual* toys and cups.
- **Backup & Restore:** Export all custom cards and photos to a single `.zip` file. Share it to Google Drive or Email to save your work.
